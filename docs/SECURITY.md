## Overview

Fieldscore is a mobile agricultural insurance application designed for farmers in Kenya. Security is a critical aspect of the application as it handles sensitive user data, financial information, and insurance claims. The following security measures have been implemented to protect the application and its users.

## Input Validation

### Validation Utility

The application includes a comprehensive validation utility (`src/utils/validation.ts`) that provides:

- **Structured Validation Rules**: Pre-defined rules for common validation scenarios
- **Field-specific Validation**: Custom validation for Kenyan phone numbers, National IDs, etc.
- **Input Sanitization**: Protection against XSS and injection attacks
- **Comprehensive Error Reporting**: Detailed validation error messages

### Key Features

- **Required Field Validation**: Ensures mandatory fields are completed
- **Format Validation**: Validates email addresses, phone numbers, and other formatted data
- **Length Validation**: Enforces minimum and maximum length constraints
- **Pattern Matching**: Uses regular expressions for complex validation rules
- **Custom Validation**: Supports custom validation functions for specific business rules

### Usage Example

```typescript
import { validate, ValidationRules } from '../utils/validation';

// Validate a phone number
const result = validate(phoneNumber, [
  ValidationRules.required('Phone number is required'),
  ValidationRules.isKenyanPhone('Must be a valid Kenyan phone number')
]);

if (!result.isValid) {
  // Handle validation errors
  console.error(result.errors);
}
```

## Data Encryption

### Encryption Utility

The application includes an encryption utility (`src/utils/encryption.ts`) that provides:

- **Data Encryption**: Secures sensitive data stored on the device
- **Secure Storage**: Wrapper around Expo's SecureStore with fallbacks
- **Key Management**: Automatic generation and secure storage of encryption keys

### Key Features

- **String Encryption**: Encrypts sensitive strings before storage
- **Object Encryption**: Encrypts entire objects with JSON serialization
- **Platform Compatibility**: Works across iOS, Android, and web platforms
- **Secure Key Storage**: Stores encryption keys in secure storage
- **Transparent API**: Simple API for encrypting and decrypting data

### Usage Example

```typescript
import { secureStore, secureRetrieve } from '../utils/encryption';

// Store sensitive data
await secureStore('user_token', token);

// Retrieve sensitive data
const token = await secureRetrieve('user_token');
```

## API Security

### API Rate Limiting

The application includes an API rate limiter (`src/services/apiRateLimiter.ts`) that provides:

- **Request Rate Limiting**: Prevents abuse of API endpoints
- **Endpoint-specific Limits**: Different limits for different types of endpoints
- **Offline Tracking**: Tracks requests even when offline
- **Automatic Recovery**: Resets limits after the time window expires

### Secure API Client

The application includes a secure API client (`src/services/apiClient.ts`) that provides:

- **Request/Response Encryption**: Encrypts sensitive API traffic
- **Request Signing**: Authenticates requests to prevent tampering
- **Retry with Exponential Backoff**: Handles transient failures gracefully
- **Offline Request Queueing**: Queues requests when offline for later processing
- **Comprehensive Error Handling**: Detailed error reporting and recovery

### Key Features

- **Authentication**: Automatically adds authentication tokens to requests
- **Content Type Negotiation**: Handles different content types and formats
- **Request Tracking**: Logs and monitors API requests
- **Timeout Handling**: Gracefully handles request timeouts
- **Network Status Awareness**: Adapts behavior based on network connectivity

### Usage Example

```typescript
import { Api } from '../services/apiClient';

// Make a GET request
const data = await Api.get('/farmers/123');

// Make a POST request with data
const result = await Api.post('/farmers', {
  name: 'John Doe',
  phone: '254712345678'
});
```

## Error Handling & Reporting

### Error Reporting Service

The application includes an error reporting service (`src/services/errorReporting.ts`) that provides:

- **Structured Error Logging**: Categorizes errors by severity
- **Context Capture**: Captures relevant context for debugging
- **Offline Support**: Queues error reports when offline
- **Device Information**: Includes device and app information in reports

### Key Features

- **Error Severity Levels**: INFO, WARNING, ERROR, CRITICAL
- **Stack Trace Capture**: Captures JavaScript stack traces
- **User Context**: Associates errors with user sessions
- **Offline Queueing**: Stores errors when offline for later reporting
- **Global Error Handler**: Catches unhandled exceptions

### Usage Example

```typescript
import { ErrorReporting, ErrorSeverity } from '../services/errorReporting';

try {
  // Risky operation
  processPayment(amount);
} catch (error) {
  // Log the error with context
  ErrorReporting.logError(
    ErrorSeverity.ERROR,
    'Payment processing failed',
    error,
    { amount, userId: currentUser.id }
  );
}
```

## Analytics & Monitoring

### Analytics Service

The application includes an analytics service (`src/services/analytics.ts`) that provides:

- **Event Tracking**: Tracks user actions and application events
- **Session Management**: Tracks user sessions
- **Performance Monitoring**: Measures application performance
- **Offline Support**: Queues analytics events when offline

### Key Features

- **Event Categories**: Categorizes events for better analysis
- **Custom Properties**: Supports custom properties for events
- **User Identification**: Associates events with users
- **Automatic Tracking**: Automatically tracks key application events
- **Minimal Overhead**: Optimized for minimal performance impact

### Usage Example

```typescript
import { Analytics } from '../services/analytics';

// Track a user action
Analytics.trackEvent('button_click', {
  screen: 'FarmerRegistration',
  buttonName: 'submit'
});

// Track a business event
Analytics.trackBusinessEvent('farmer_registered', {
  farmerId: farmer.id,
  location: farmer.county
});
```

## Testing

### Unit Tests

The application includes comprehensive unit tests for security features:

- **Validation Tests**: Tests for input validation rules
- **Encryption Tests**: Tests for data encryption and decryption
- **API Security Tests**: Tests for API rate limiting and security
